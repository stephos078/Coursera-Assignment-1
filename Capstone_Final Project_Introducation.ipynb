As an international student at the U of T myself, I had trouble finding good food around the campus, and I would have appreciated an application that lists a variety of options and creates a visual for me. My application also groups 37 neigborhoods in downtown Toronto into 5 areas and serves as a guide for students who are interested in exploring some of the city's most popular venues."

I also normalized the dataset to help interpret features with different magnitudes and distributions equally.\n\nI only included venues in the downtown as it is where most of the venues worth visiting are concentrated in. Plus, most of students who are originally from outside Toronto live in the downtown area, so I only focused on the venues that are most relevant to them."
